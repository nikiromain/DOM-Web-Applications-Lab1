# Lab 1- Basic Web Applications

Ensure that you apply appropriate validation to each question. 

1. Develop a web application that requests from the user two numbers, via a form.  The web application should then calculate the sum of two numbers 

2. Develop a web application that requests from the user a person’s name and their weight in kilograms (kg) via a form. 


 The web application should then convert the person’s weight in pounds and display the answer to the user on the web page. NOTE, 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds.

3. Develop a web application that requests a student name, number and the student’s exam score out of 100 via a form. 

    Your application is then to match the exam score to a letter grade and output the grade to the console. Calculate the letter grade as follows:

     Exam score


     90 and above
    A
     80–89.99
    B
     70–79.99
    C
     60–69.99
    D
     below 60
    F



4. Design a web application that will receive the weight of a parcel and determine the delivery charge for that parcel. Charges are calculated as follows:
    Parcel Weight (kg)
Cost per kg ($)
    <2.5 kg
$3.50 per kg
    2.5–5 kg
$2.85 per kg
    >5-7 kg
$2.45 per kg
    >7




$3.25 per kg
 

5. The tax payable on taxable income for employees in a certain country is set out in the following table:

Taxable income
Tax payable
From $1.00–$4461.99
Nil
From $4462.00–$17 893.99
Nil plus 30 cents for each $
in excess of $4462.00
From $17 894.00–$29 499.99
$4119.00 plus 35 cents for each $
in excess of $17 894.00
From $29 500.00–$45 787.99
$8656.00 plus 46 cents for each $
in excess of $29 500.00
$45 788.00 and over
$11 179.00 plus 60 cents for each $
in excess of $45 788.00


Write a web application that will request the taxable income amount via a form and calculate and display the tax payable on that amount.
